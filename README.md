# auto-patrol-template
This is a template for a mod controlling fleets spawning on their own and following paths to their destinations.  
The paths are calculated by BFS and are stored. Fleets going from the ame origin to the same destination will use the same stored path (so only one BFS for a group of fleets).  
This mod requires SLEX (https://github.com/calniotrey/stellaris-list-extender) to use the lists.  
  
Feel free to use this template into your own mods as you would like. To adapt the template to your needs, look for "PERSO" in the code, it will show you which lines you are most susceptible to want to adapt.  
Please remember to put SLEX as a dependancy in your mod, don't include it directly.  
  
If you have any questions about this template or SLEX in general, feel free to PM me on the Stellaris Modding Den discord (I'm Erdnuss)
